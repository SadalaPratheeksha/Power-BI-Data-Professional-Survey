In this mini Power BI project, we transformed raw survey data into meaningful insights by leveraging Power Query for data preparation and transformation, followed by creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key findings from the survey responses.

Project Objective:
The goal of the project was to analyze and present insights from a professional survey that gathered data on employee satisfaction, job roles, compensation, and career growth within an organization. Using Power BI, the survey data was transformed and visualized to help stakeholders understand key trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.

Key Steps:

Data Import and Transformation (Power Query):
Loaded raw survey data (in Excel or CSV format) into Power BI.
Used Power Query to clean the data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
Transformed the data by creating new calculated columns and grouping responses into relevant categories.
Applied filters and sorting to improve data structure, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple visualizations, including:
Bar charts to represent the average salary by job role.
Pie charts to show the difficulty rate to break in to data career.
Area chat=rt to show the favourite programming language of the people working in data career.
Gauge chart to track the happiness index with Work/Life balance and Salary.

Insights and Reporting:
Presented key findings in the form of interactive reports and dashboards, enabling stakeholders to identify areas of concern.

Outcome:
The final Power BI dashboard provided an interactive, user-friendly interface that allowed decision-makers to easily explore survey data, spot trends, and take informed actions to improve employee satisfaction and organizational efficiency.
